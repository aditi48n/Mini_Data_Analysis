## Project Description
This repository includes a summary of the EDA project  performed as part of University of British Columbia's graduate course [STAT 545](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/). The original work and all associated milestones are available [here](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/Aditi_MiniDataAnalysis). 

:evergreen_tree: The dataset used for analysis has been obtained from The City of Vancouver's [open data portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/). It includes a listing of all public trees on boulevards in the City of Vancouver and provides data on tree coordinates, species and other related characteristics. The dataset refreshes daily on weekdays with some attributes taking longer to be updated. 


## Executive Summary:

This report delves into a detailed exploratory analysis of the Vancouver Trees dataset and spans various aspects from basic data cleaning to advanced analytical insights focusing on urban planning perspectives. 

Key sections of the analysis include data cleaning, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, and all these revolve around the valuable insights that can be extracted about the distribution, variety, and state of trees across different neighborhoods in Vancouver.

## Introduction:

### Background:

Urban greenery, particularly public trees, contributes significantly to the environment, aesthetics, and overall quality of life in urban centers. Understanding the distribution, health, and diversity of these trees is crucial for city planners, environmentalists, and conservation officers.

### Objectives:

The primary objective of this analysis is to explore the Vancouver Trees dataset to:

1) Understand the distribution of trees in different neighborhoods.
2) Identify the most common tree types.
3) Analyze the relationship between various factors like age, diameter, and geographical location of trees.
4) Offer insights that could aid urban planning and conservation policies.

### Data Source:

The dataset is courtesy of The City of Vancouverâ€™s Open Data Portal, consisting of 146,611 records spanning 20 different attributes including the type, age, location, and diameter of public trees.

## Methodology:

### Data Cleaning:

The initial phase involved preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and correcting formats where necessary. Specifically, data imputation techniques were employed to address the gaps in crucial variables like planting date, latitude, and longitude.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

Univariate Analysis was used to examine the distribution of trees across different neighborhoods and according to the most prevalent tree types.Bivariate Analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the age and diameter of Kwanzan flowering cherry trees (the most predominant tree type), particularly whether older trees tend to have larger diameters. Finally, Multivariate Analysis was used to explore trends and variations in tree ages and diameters across different neighborhoods and tree types.

## Results and Discussions:

### Distribution of Trees:

The analysis revealed that Renfrew-Collingwood has the highest number of trees planted, highlighting potential disparities in greenery distribution across neighborhoods.

### Common Tree Types:

"Kwanzan Flowering Cherry" surfaced as the most prevalent tree, indicating a preference or suitability factor influencing tree variety in urban planting scenarios.

### Tree Age and Diameter Correlation:

The study showed a weak correlation between tree age and diameter across most neighborhoods. This suggests that factors other than age may influence tree growth, stressing the need for more detailed environmental and genetic studies.

### Trends in Age and Diameter:

A complex interaction between tree type, age, and location was observed when considering diameter across different neighborhoods. These insights are vital for understanding local ecological dynamics and informing future urban forestry decisions.


## Conclusions:

The analysis of the Vancouver Trees dataset provided valuable insights into the urban forest's structure and composition. The findings underscore the importance of equitable greenery distribution, biodiversity, and the need for understanding factors influencing tree growth. While certain tree types are more prevalent, there is a need to ensure diversity to enhance urban ecosystems' resilience. The weak correlation between tree age and diameter points towards other underlying factors affecting tree growth, warranting further study.

## Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made:

1) Diversity in Planting: Increase the planting of a variety of tree species around the different neighbourhoods to prevent widespread problems caused by pests and other diseases.

2) Spatial Analysis for Planting: Perform detailed geographical analyses to identify areas deficient in greenery and prioritize them in all future planting efforts.

3) Regular Data Update and Quality Control: Ensure the dataset is updated regularly and maintained with minimal missing or incorrect information for more accurate future analyses.

## Limitations and Future Work:
This study has its own set of limitations, primarily due to data gaps and the inability to account for all environmental and genetic factors influencing tree growth. 

Future work could expand on this preliminary analysis by incorporating more environmental data, conducting a more detailed genetic diversity study, and using advanced statistical or machine learning techniques for more nuanced insights.
