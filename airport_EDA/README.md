# Mini Data Analysis

## Project Description
This repository includes an EDA project performed on a airports dataset obtained from Kaggle.  

✈️ The dataset used for analysis has been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshalhonde/global-aviation-hub-dataset-of-airports-worldwide/data). It includes a comprehensive collection of airport information from around the world and provides data on airport coordinates, types, elevation and other characteristics. 

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive analysis of the global airport dataset sourced from Kaggle has been carried out. I focus on categorizing airport types, understanding their geographical distribution, analyzing characteristics like elevation levels, and the implications of these factors for global connectivity and aviation challenges. 

Since, airports are critical for global connectivity, facilitating not just passenger travel but also the transport of goods between continents, their locations, characteristics, and capacities have significant implications for regional development, trade routes, and travel. Therefore, this analysis could be pivotal for stakeholders in aviation, travel, logistics, and international commerce.

### Objectives

The analysis aims to interpret the global airport dataset to:

1) Categorize airports based on their types and identify patterns or anomalies.
2) Analyze geographical distribution and explore factors influencing this aspect.
3) Investigate airport elevations in relation to their geographical locations.
4) Understand broader implications for logistics, travel, and environmental considerations.

## Methodology:

### Data Cleaning:

Data preparation involved removing duplicates and handling missing or inconsistent entries.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

This stage included:

1) Classification Analysis: Sorting airports by type and identifying global and regional trends.

2) Geospatial Analysis: Using coordinates to plot airports globally, assessing distribution patterns, and identifying potentially underserved regions.
   
3) Elevation Study: Analyzing airport elevations worldwide, understanding how topography influences airport placement, and the potential challenges involved.

**Note: Results are shown and discussed at length in the jupyter notebook**

## Conclusion:

The analysis portrays the critical role of airports in global and regional connectivity. Furthermore, insights regarding airport distribution, types, and elevations offer a nuanced understanding of global aviation infrastructure. These findings are essential for policymakers, investors, and developers in optimizing future advancements in the aviation sector.

## Recommendations:

1) Infrastructure Investment: Prioritize the development of airports in underserved regions to boost economic opportunities.
 
2) Environmental and Logistical Planning: Consider environmental impacts and logistical requirements when planning new airports or expanding existing facilities.
   
3) Data Enrichment and Regular Updates: Advocate for enriched datasets with real-time updates on airport statuses, capacities, and services.
